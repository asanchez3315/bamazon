This application can be used for inventory purposes for a retail business For both the customer side which allows the customer to purchase an item while the manager side  can be used for adding a new product, restocking, etc...


# FUNCTIONALITY

The customer app works as soon as you run the application ,it loads the table and display all items for sale and the coresponding data for each item. You'll be prompted for item number and desired quantity.

The Manager app like the customer app, loads the table when you run the application and it asks 3 tasks, restock, add a new product, or delete a product.

 I have to fix the add a new product feature, beacause it does add the item but it labels it as undefined.
